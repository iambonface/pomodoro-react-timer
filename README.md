## A freeCodeCamp Pomodoro Timer Challenge

    Built with ReactJs, this Pomodoro Timer has a time display, applause alarm and colorful trigger buttons.
    The Session and Breaks components have alternating colors to differentiate them when displaying time.

## User Stories and Challenge Requirements
    User Story 1: I can start a 25 minute pomodoro, and the timer will go off once 25 minutes has elapsed.
    User Story 2: I can reset the clock for my next pomodoro.
    User Story 3: I can customize the length of each pomodoro.

## Dependecies
    "normalize.css": "^7.0.0",
    "react": "^15.6.1",
    "react-dom": "^15.6.1",

## Developer Recommendation
    Moment JS was not used in this application and time (hours, minutes, seconds) were manually calculated.
    For faster development, we recommend use of MomentJS, but not necessary

## Developers guide
    $ git clone https://github.com/iambonface/pomodoro-react-timer.git yourfoldername
    $ cd yourfoldername
    $ npm install
    $ npm start #This will open on localhost:3000

    #open new terminal, cd to project and fire up Atom
    $ atom . #I noticed Atom is user friendler with JSX but you are free to use whatever editor
